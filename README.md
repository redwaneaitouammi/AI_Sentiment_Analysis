# AI_Sentiment_Analysis

In this project, I will follow the tensorflow guides to develop a sentiment analysis model based on user comments about movies they watched.

I will use the Large Movie Review Dataset : This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets.
